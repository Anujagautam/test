DevOps Roadmap
1. Foundations

Before diving into DevOps tools, you need strong basics:

Operating Systems (Linux preferred)

Commands, file system, permissions, networking, process management.

Networking & Security

IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, firewalls, load balancers.

Scripting & Programming

Bash scripting (essential).

A programming language (Python/Go) for automation.

After high school, I have many aspirations I want to achieve. I aim to attend both college and law school. Once I gain some experience in my career, I hope to settle down, marry, and start a family. While I desire a fulfilling career, raising a family is equally important to me. Iâ€™m uncertain about the future or whether these plans will materialize because life can be unpredictable. Many challenges may arise as I pursue my goals, particularly the demands of college and law school, which require extensive studying, hard work, and commitment to become a lawyer. However, with diligence and resolve, I intend to reach my aspirations, whatever they may be, and realize my full potential.
